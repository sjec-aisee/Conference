            <h2>Instructions for Authors</h2>
            <ul class="reg-info-list" style="color: var(--secondary-color); text-align: justify;">
                <li>Kindly note that 2026 SJEC CONFERENCE will follow a "double-blind" review process. All submitted
                    papers will be judged based on their quality, presentation and relevance through a "double-blind"
                    review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. Therefore, the
                    authors are required to preserve the anonymity of submission, while at the same time allowing the
                    reader to fully gain the context of related past work, including their own. <span
                        style="color:red; font-weight:600;">Attention -- Papers that do not conform with "double-blind
                        submission" policies will be rejected without review.</span> Please read the guidelines (given
                    below in the subsequent section named "Instructions for authors: Guidelines to preserve anonymity
                    for 'double-blind' submissions") to preserve anonymity with double-blind submission.</li>

                <li><span style="color:red; font-weight:600;">Attention</span> -- While submitting the paper via CMT,
                    please ensure that all authors are added in the CMT system. Note that this does not require
                    including author details in the PDF of the paper; authors and their details must be entered only in
                    CMT. Please note that adding new authors will not be permitted once the paper has been submitted for
                    review. However, removal of authors may be permitted with proper justification, and the IEEE
                    Mangalore Subsection reserves the right to make the final decision in such cases.</li>

                <li>Since the "Accepted and presented papers" of 2026 SJEC CONFERENCE will be submitted for possible
                    publication in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library (Conference Record #70686), the manuscript must
                    strictly adhere to the standard IEEE two column format and must not be more than 6 pages.</li>

                <li>Typesetting instructions and sample templates: <a
                        href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank"
                        style="color: var(--accent-color); font-weight: 600;">IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference
                        Proceedings</a></li>

                <li>The Camera Ready Copy (CRC) of every "accepted" paper will be subjected to the "similarity check"
                    using IEEE CrossCheck and Prohibited Participants List (PPL). The CRC that fails these checks would
                    be rejected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: blue; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Instructions for authors: Guidelines to
                preserve anonymity for "double-blind" submissions:</h3>
            <ul class="reg-info-list" style="color: var(--secondary-color); text-align: justify;">
                <li>Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page of the PDF file that you submit for
                    review. This information must be included in the final camera ready copy if your paper gets
                    accepted. While submitting your paper for review, you need to include all the author details only at
                    the registration page. The PDF file of the paper should not have the author information.</li>
                <li>Remove acknowledgments of identifying names and funding sources from the PDF file that you submit
                    for review. This information must be included in the final camera ready copy if your paper gets
                    accepted.</li>
                <li>Remove project titles or names that can be used to trace back to the authors via a web search
                    engine.</li>
                <li>Name your files carefully. The source file names (e.g., "Rajesh.dvi") are often embedded in the
                    final output as accessible comments.</li>
                <li>Use care in referring to your previous works as related works. Do not omit references to provide
                    anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, you can reference your
                    past work in the third person format, just like any other piece of related work by another author.
                    For example, instead of "Recently, we have proposed a new protocol [9] ...," sentences in the spirit
                    of "Recently, the authors in [9] have proposed a new protocol ..." may be used.</li>
                <li>Papers with the same title and abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org,
                    or shared via public mailing lists or communicated to other conferences/journals/publications.</li>
            </ul>

                policy:</h3>
            <ul class="reg-info-list" style="color: var(--secondary-color); text-align: justify;">
                <li>IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its
                    removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.</li>
                <li>Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been
                    submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very
                    seriously and the IEEE will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Kindly
                    follow these links for more details: <a href="#" style="color:red;">IEEE Policy on Plagiarism</a>
                    and <a href="#" style="color:red;">IEEE Policy on Double Submission</a>.</li>
                <li>Submitted papers must be unpublished and not currently under review for any other publication. The
                    authors of accepted papers will need to sign an IEEE Copyright form and present their paper at the
                    conference.</li>
            </ul>

                The Microsoft CMT service was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This
                service was provided for free by Microsoft, and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud
                services as well as for software development and support.
